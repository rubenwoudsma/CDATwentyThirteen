 * Hi there, I assume you would like to know how the theme has been build. In correspondence with the 960 grid system I am using the following three files:
 *
 *	> stylesheets/skeleton.css
 *	> stylesheets/base.css
 *	> stylesheets/layout.css
 *
 * If you'd realy would like to make some customizations for this theme, I'd advice you to create a child version for this theme.
