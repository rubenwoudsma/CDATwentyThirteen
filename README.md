CDATwentyThirteen
===

This is a starter theme for department websites of the CDA in the Netherlands (http://www.cda.nl). It has been based upon the `underscores` starters theme and has been enhanced with several other options to match the new layout of the websites for CDA based upon the new style.

Below you can find an overview of the enhancements of this theme:

* Integrated Theme Options Framework to make several settings customizable.
* Enhanced the author profile with additional fields.
* Changed the authors slug to reflect the actual usage.
* Added new post type (definitions [NL: Standpunten]);
* Added template page for the definitions;
* Added template for new homepage with carrousel and news section.
* Added template for author/team overview.
* Several CSS and JavaScript additions to make it more responsive.
* Integrated a taxonomy to link pages, posts, definitions and authors to eachother.
* The GPL license in license.txt. :) Use it to make something cool.
